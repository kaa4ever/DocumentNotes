# Document Notes

TestaViva needs a system to record notes for a document. The Document is discussed over a phone by a lawyer, and during that conversation notes will be taken for a given paragraph. The lawyer may then use these notes to remind them what actions he has agreed to, ex. a correction or amendment.

The frontend is already in place, so an API is required to create, read, update but not delete.

We have provided a skeleton installation of Symfony.

* In addition to above we would like to see some sensible documentation.
* Some verification of the input.
* Reponses should be json, with the appropriate headers.
* Some (unit) testing.
* Otherwise the code should be clean.


Please write your code, and push it back up to this repository as a feature branch, using your own name as branch name ex. feature/JensJensen.

Please note that this test should take 3-4 hours, but we will not check the time used from the pushes.
